# Applying Convolutional Neural Networks to Identify Parasitized Malaria Cells
We develop an algorithm that can detect malaria from images of segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images with 96% accuracy. Our algorithm, SimpNet-7, is a 7-layer convolutional neural network trained on the NIH Malaria dataset, containing 27,588 images of parasitized and uninfected cells. We find that SimpNet-7 achieves an F1 score of 0.955, a precision of 0.946, and a recall of 0.974. We then propose the application of this algorithm in hospitals in areas where malaria is prominent but medical resources are sparse, such as African countries.
